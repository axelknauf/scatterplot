## About

Generate a scatter plot from coordinates and names using D3.js

## How to

- Edit `scatterplot.html` and add your CSV data as JS array into `const csv = ..`
- Open `scatterplot.html` in your browser
- If labels to not dodge each other enough, try reloading. They will move
  a litte each time.

## TODO

* Chart title
* Gradient for background to indicate good/bad corners, maybe quadrants
* Historical view, animated (like https://bost.ocks.org/mike/nations/) to see movement
